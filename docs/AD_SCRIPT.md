### **Scene 1**

**Setting:** Night. Inside a car. Rain is streaking down the windshield.

**Visuals:**
RAVI (40s), a tired-looking driver, completes a long ride on a generic ride-hailing app. His face shows clear frustration. He looks at his earnings: "₹350". Just below it, a red text flashes: **"- ₹70 (30% Commission)"**.

Ravi taps his hand on the steering wheel in silent frustration.

**(Voiceover, slightly melancholic)**
*"Din bhar gaadi chalao... aur din ke akhir mein aapki mehnat ki kamai koi aur le jaaye..."*

### **Scene 2**

**Setting:** Daytime. A tea stall.

**Visuals:**
Ravi is venting to his friend, SANJAY (40s). Sanjay is calm, sipping his tea. He smiles and takes out his phone.

The Cabzi app is open. The screen proudly displays: **"Today's Earnings: ₹1850"**. Below it, there's no commission cut, just a small note: **"Daily Pass Active"**.

**SANJAY:**
(Showing his phone)
*"Bhai, app badal, kismat badal."*

**Visual 2:** Ravi's car has a flat tyre. He's not worried. He gets an **"Instant Loan"** from "Cabzi Bank" on his phone. In the next shot, he's paying the mechanic via UPI as the car gets fixed.

**Visual 3:** Ravi's daughter jumps with joy, wearing new school shoes. Ravi looks at her lovingly.
