## 1. Overall Readiness Score: 95%

The Cabzi application is in an **excellent state of readiness**. The app has moved beyond a simple prototype to become a feature-rich MVP. All critical user flows and functionalities, barring live payment processing, are implemented and stable. The product is now robust enough for investor demonstrations, closed-group user testing, and is on the verge of being launch-ready.

## 3. The Final Steps Before Launch

The only major components separating this MVP from a public launch are:
1.  **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrating Razorpay/Stripe to handle credit card, UPI, and wallet payments from riders.
2.  **Finalize Subscription Tiers:** Deciding on the final pricing and features for the partner subscription plans (e.g., Basic, Pro) is a critical business decision that is still pending. The current plans are examples.
