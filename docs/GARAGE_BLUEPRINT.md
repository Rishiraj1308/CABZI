## 2. ⚙️ Garage Role & Functioning

Garage ka role ek **Hotspot Hub** jaisa hai:

*   **On-spot repair:** Job freelancer mechanic le sakta hai.
*   **Major repair / towing:** Job garage mechanic ke paas route hoga.
*   **Auto-allocation:** Rider ko dikhega → “Nearest ResQ Partner” + “Curocity Garage Option”

### Revenue Split

*   **Garage job** = Payout directly Garage current a/c me
*   **Mechanic job** = Payout directly Mechanic a/c me
*   Curocity only takes subscription, not per job commission
