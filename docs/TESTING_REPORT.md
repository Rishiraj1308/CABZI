## 3. Top 3 Bugs / Issues to Fix Next

1.  **BUG-001 (High Priority):** Geocoding Failure is Silent. If a rider enters a vague address (e.g., "Delhi"), the app doesn't find it but also doesn't inform the user. It just fails. **Fix:** Add a "Location not found" `Toast` notification.
2.  **BUG-002 (Medium Priority):** No "Loading" State on Buttons. On slow networks, when a user clicks "Find Rides" or "Confirm Ride", the button doesn't show a loading spinner, making the user think the app is frozen. **Fix:** Add a loading state to all major CTA buttons.
3.  **BUG-003 (Low Priority):** Inconsistent Padding on Cards. Some dashboard cards have slightly different internal padding, leading to minor visual misalignment. **Fix:** A quick UI pass to standardize all card paddings.

## 4. Final Verdict

The Cabzi application is in a very healthy state. It has passed all major "happy path" test cases. The focus should now shift from building core features to **polishing the user experience, handling edge cases/errors, and completing the ResQ Partner module.**
