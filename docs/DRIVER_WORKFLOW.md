# Curocity: The Driver Partner Workflow

This document outlines the complete, step-by-step journey for a Curocity Path Partner (Driver), from going online to completing a ride and getting paid.

---

### 1. Login & Go Online

The driver's day begins by logging into their dedicated dashboard at `/driver`. The most crucial action is toggling their status to **"Online"**. This signals to the Curocity network that they are ready to accept rides and begins sharing their live location for dispatch.

### 2. Receive Ride Request

When a nearby user requests a ride, the driver receives an instant push notification and a ride request pop-up appears on their screen. This pop-up contains all the essential information needed to make a quick decision:

*   **Pickup & Destination:** Clear addresses for the start and end of the trip.
*   **Estimated Fare:** The total amount the driver will earn for the ride.
*   **Distance to Pickup:** How far the rider is from the driver's current location.
*   **15-Second Timer:** A countdown to either **Accept** or **Decline** the request.

### 3. Accept the Ride

Upon tapping "Accept", the UI immediately transitions to an active ride view. The screen now displays a map with the optimal route to the rider's pickup location, along with the rider's name and rating.

### 4. Arrive at Pickup & Verify OTP

Once the driver reaches the rider's location, they tap the **"Arrived"** button. For security, the trip cannot begin until the driver collects a **4-digit OTP (One-Time Password)** from the rider and enters it into the app. This ensures the correct rider is in the vehicle.

### 5. Trip in Progress

After the OTP is successfully verified, the trip officially starts. The driver's map updates to show the live route to the rider's destination, complete with turn-by-turn navigation guidance.

### 6. End Trip

Upon safely arriving at the destination, the driver taps the **"End Trip"** button.

### 7. Collect Payment

The app immediately displays a professional, itemized bill for the rider. A key feature of this screen is the transparent breakdown of the fare, which includes:

*   Base Fare
*   Distance Fare
*   A line item for **"Commission" showing ₹0**, reinforcing our core promise.
*   The final, **Total Amount** to be collected in cash.

### 8. Confirm Payment Received

After the driver collects the cash payment from the rider, they tap the **"Confirm Cash Received"** button in the app.

### 9. Ride Completed & Instant Payout

A final summary screen appears, congratulating the driver on completing the trip and showing their total earnings. This full amount is **instantly credited** to their secure **Curocity Bank Wallet**.

### 10. Return to Dashboard

The driver taps "Done" and is taken back to the main dashboard, where they are immediately available to receive the next ride request, maximizing their earning potential.

This entire workflow is designed to be seamless, transparent, and empowering, putting the driver in control of their business.
